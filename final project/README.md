#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHBubJv4ksw
#### Description: Here is my final project submission for CS50x Course. I decided to make Calorie Counter App i can use in my day to day life. In this app Users are able to calculate their optimal diet, save this amount of calories and then log foods they eat throughout the day. For food stats i used official data from MyPyramid Food Raw Data. All the informations are stored in Local storage so that even after ending your session the information you used stayed saved and you can continue where you left off. This Project is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. More than desing I Focused on functionality. Inside of each HTML is basic Web-Page and all the functions are stored in app.js, here is where the magic happens, it also took me the most amount of time. I learn how to operate with querySelectors and Event listeners. It was definetly a challange but at the end it was worth it.
